            Hitori Gotō is an extremely introverted girl who has trouble making friends or working in groups at school. When she sees a rock band being interviewed on TV, she decides to get into playing guitar, thinking it will make her more friends. Unfortunately, her social anxiety keeps her from making friends throughout middle school, but she finds some modest success playing covers of popular songs and posting them online under the alias "guitarhero." After struggling to be sociable during her first year of highschool, a girl named Nijika Ijichi begs her to replace a guitarist who left the group before the band plays their show. Hitori follows Nijika to an underground bar and meets her other bandmate, Ryō Yamada, who plays the bass. Despite playing poorly at the live show, Hitori is glad that the others gave her the nickname "Bocchi," and that they are fans of her "guitarhero" channel (though they are unaware Hitori is guitarhero). However, Hitori races home shortly after the show, feeling exhausted from the various social interactions that day.
