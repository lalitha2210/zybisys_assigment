        A thousand years ago, the original Thirteen Court Guard Squads consisted of ruthless and barbaric killers without shared purpose, who partook in slaughtering the Wandenreich. Yamamoto and Chōjirō defeated Yhwach; afterwards, Yamamoto adopted a peaceful philosophy and formed a unified Court Guard system. In the present, Yamamoto is bisected and disintegrated by Yhwach. Ichigo breaks through the Jail and finds a dying Byakuya, who tearfully asks Ichigo to protect the Soul Society before his Zanpakutō shatters. Ichigo trades blows with Yhwach's Reishi Sword using Getsuga Tenshō, but is quickly defeated. Yhwach attempts to stab Ichigo in the neck but is countered. Yhwach reveals Ichigo's mother was Quincy, making him part-Quincy, which allowed Ichigo to break Quilge's Jail and unconsciously counter Yhwach's attack. Shadows appear to transport the Quincy back to Silbern and Yhwach realizes that Aizen used his shikai on him to lose track of time. Ichigo tries to strike Yhwach again, but his Zanpakutō is destroyed by Jugram Haschwalth.
