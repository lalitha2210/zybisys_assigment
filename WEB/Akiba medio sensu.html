                In 1985, an older maid is walking into a teahouse in Akihabara when she is gunned down by a rival maid. 14 years later, Akihabara is covered by multiple different maid cafes as a girl named Nagomi Wahira prepares to begin her new job working for the "Oinky Doink Cafe," a pigsty-themed maid cafe. Nagomi is quickly pressed into service along with the stern yet professional 35 year old Ranko Mannen as new maids that same day. Despite their enthusiasm for the job, their lack of experience creates problems for the other maids. Suddenly, a hard-boiled otaku shows up, threatening the manager of the cafe for not paying her dues to his organization, "Creatureland." Looking for a way out, the manager offers Nagomi to handle "the Wuv-Wuv Moonbeam issue," tasking her with hand-delivering a letter to the rival maid cafe. Before that, the manager gives some money for the ramen shop owner downstairs, and allows Ranko to go with Nagomi. After eating some ramen, the two girls head over to Wuv-Wuv Moonbeam, and find out that the letter was actually a provocation to attack. Ranko shoots the head maid of Wuv-Wuv Moonbeam with a gun she got from the ramen chef, and then kills the rest of the rival cafe's maids while fleeing with Nagomi. The two eventually return to the pigsty cafe. Nagomi, traumatized from the events of the night, plans to flee, but is stuck when Ranko locks the door to her bedroom and announces that they are roommates.
