            Ittoki Sakuraba is a regular middle school student along with his childhood friend Kosetsu. His family owns a local supermarket and with his father deceased, his mother Yumika encourages him to take numerous extracurricular activities to prepare himself for the future. One day, a girl named Satomi Tsubaki approaches Ittokki and asks to go out on a date with him. Caught off guard by the sudden confession, Ittoki agrees, but is surprised when Satomi takes him straight to her house. However, once he arrives, Satomi and a team of ninjas attack him. He is rescued by Kosetsu, his uncle Tokisada, and the supermarket employees who are all also ninjas themselves. Yumika then explains that shinobi have adapted to modern times and still exist to this day. With his father's death, Ittoki is his successor to be the 19th head of the Iga Shinobi Clan, which makes him a target for the rival Koga Shinobi Clan. Meanwhile, the current head of the Koga, Kidou, declares to his clan that they will take revenge on the Iga for the death of their previous head, Kishinmaru.
